# Data Description

IMDb is an online database of information related to films, television series, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical **reviews**.<br/>

# Project Overview

Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. This is a popular way for organizations to determine and categorize opinions about a product, service, or idea. Sentiment Analysis uses natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. <br/>

The aim of this project is to classify whether a certain review is positive or negative.
